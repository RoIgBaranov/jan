        <h2>About the project:</h2>
        <p>This website is the service of accumulation of actual problems of science (firstly in mathematics) and attraction of fincancial resourses to stimulate progress of research.</p>
        <p>The project is inspired by Famous Hungarian mathematician Paul Erd≈ës, who often proposed some amount of money as an award for a certain problem solution.</p>
        <p>Also, the project is inspired by words of Sir Isaak Newton: "I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."</p>
        <p>So the sense amd the global purpose pf our porject is to outline, to approxi,ate to that great ocean of truth mentioned by Newton.</p>
